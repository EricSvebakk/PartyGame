# PartyGame

A game made for the buddy-week at the Institute for Informatics!

<br/>

## How to play
Find a pack of cards and choose a difficulty! The difficulty decides the distribution of cards. Take turns picking a card from the top of the deck. The card decides which prompt to do. Look for the card number in the top-left of each colour

but if the card is:
* a king, all guys drink
* a queen, all girls drink
* a jack, increase the number of sips for each colour by 1

after picking a card, you can decide to use a chance. Chances are both good and bad.
